# burger

This is an app that lists out the current burgers and allows you to "Devour" them once you have tried them.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, with an option to "devour" it. Once it has been eaten it will be grayed out and moved to the right side of the screen. The right side will serve as a list of the burgers that have been eaten.

all burgers are stored in a MySQL database.
